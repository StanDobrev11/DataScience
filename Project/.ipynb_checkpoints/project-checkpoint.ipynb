    "# Study of the Effects of ENSO on Tropical Depressions in the North Pacific Ocean\n",
    "\n",
    "## ABSTRACT\n",
    "\n",
    "The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a critical driver of climate variability, with profound impacts on weather patterns across the globe, particularly in the North Pacific Ocean. This study investigates the influence of ENSO phases—El Niño, La Niña, and Neutral on the formation, frequency, intensity, and tracks of tropical depressions (TD) in the North Pacific Ocean. Utilizing historical sea surface temperature (SST) data and tropical depression records, the study employs statistical analysis and geospatial techniques to explore correlations between ENSO phases and tropical depression activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis reveals significant variations in the frequency and intensity of tropical depressions across different ENSO phases, with El Niño years showing a higher frequency of intense tropical depressions in the Central and Eastern Pacific, while La Niña years are associated with a westward shift in tropical depression activity towards the Western Pacific. The study also examines the changes in SST anomalies during different ENSO phases and their relationship with tropical depression formation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings provide a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between ENSO and tropical depression dynamics in the North Pacific, offering valuable insights for improving the prediction and management of tropical depressions in the context of ENSO-driven climate variability. The results have significant implications for forecasting, disaster preparedness, and climate adaptation strategies in regions affected by tropical depressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The El Niño–Southern Oscillation is a single climate phenomenon that periodically fluctuates between three phases: Neutral, La Niña or El Niño. La Niña and El Niño are opposite phases in the oscillation which are deemed to occur when specific ocean and atmospheric conditions are reached or exceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**El Niño** is the phase where the ocean waters in the central and eastern Pacific become warmer than usual. This warming can cause significant changes in weather patterns, such as increased rainfall in some areas and droughts in others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**La Niña** is the opposite phase, where the ocean waters in these regions become cooler than average. This cooling also disrupts typical weather patterns, often leading to different sets of extremes, like more intense storms or colder temperatures in certain areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neutral** refers to the periods between El Niño and La Niña when sea surface temperatures are closer to their average, and global weather patterns are generally more stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "ENSO is one of the most important drivers of climate variability on Earth, affecting everything from rainfall and temperatures to the occurrence of natural disasters like floods, droughts, and storms. Information on the phases and temperature deviations can be found in the [NOAA](https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php) website.  Warm and cold periods are calculated based on a threshold of $\\pm0.5^oC $ for the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) in the area of $5^oN-5^oS, 170^oW-120^oW$ (red rectangle).\n",
    "On average, the period starts July-August and peaks November-January. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below diagrams showing the **SST** (sea surface temperature) of the ocean during peak of each ENSO phase. The data is obtained from [NASA Earth Data](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/topics/ocean/ocean-temperature/sea-surface-temperature) website."

    "### Tropical depressions (TD)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on understanding how ENSO affects TDs in the North Pacific Ocean. TDs are low-pressure weather systems that can develop into more severe storms, such as tropical storms or hurricanes. By analyzing historical data on sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and TDs, this study aims to uncover patterns and relationships between the different phases of ENSO and the behavior of TDs in the Eastern, Central, and Western Pacific regions. Understanding these connections can help improve forecasts and prepare for the impacts of these powerful weather systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The season of the TDs in **Eastern and Central North Pacific** officially begins in mid-May (Eastern Pacific) or June 1st (Central Pacific) and ends on November 30th, with peak activity typically occurring from August to September. In **Western North Pacific**, unlike the Eastern and Central Pacific, has TDs occurring throughout the year. However, the most active period is from July to October, with a significant concentration of storms.\n",
    "\n",
    "ENSO peaks in December and the conditions typically take several months to influence global weather patterns fully. Then the primary effects on tropical storms and depressions in the North Pacific would generally be observed during the summer and fall of the year to follow. Basis on the above assumption, the pahse of ENSO will be applied to the years from 1950 till now. The value of the ENSO column of the table below will reflect the ENSO year phase. 1 - El Niño influenced year, 0 -Neutral year, -1 - La Niña influenced year. The phases are depending on whether ONI is greater than 0.5, less than -0.5, or between -0.5 and 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Establishing Hypotheses\n",
    "**Hypothesis 1**: ENSO and Frequency of Tropical Depressions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis $H_0$: There is **no significant difference** in the frequency of tropical depressions across different ENSO phases (El Niño, La Niña, Neutral).\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis $H_1$: There **is a significant difference** in the frequency of tropical depressions across different ENSO phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 2**: ENSO and Intensity of Tropical Depressions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis $H_0$: ENSO phases **do not** significantly affect the intensity of tropical depressions (measured by metrics such as maximum wind speed or minimum central pressure).\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis $H_1$: ENSO phases significantly affect the intensity of tropical depressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 3**: ENSO and Tropical Depressions tracks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis $H_0$: ENSO phases **do not** significantly affect the track of tropical depressions.\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis $H_1$: ENSO phases significantly affect the track of tropical depressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypotheses will be applied for TDs in NW, Central and NE Pacific Ocean\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "In the context of studying the effects of ENSO on TDs in the North Pacific Ocean, EDA will involve temporal, geospatial, and intensity analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temporal Analysis\n",
    "This analysis will be used to understand how the frequency of TDs varies over time and how this is influenced by different ENSO phases. Additionally, this analysis will explore how sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies correlate with these variations. We start by calculating the frequency of a TD per calendar year. Frequency values are calculated by counting the number of occurrences of tropical depressions within a specific time frame, such as annually. It will help to quantify how active a particular year or ENSO phase was in terms of tropical depression formation."

The slightly higher frequency during Neutral years suggests that in the NW Pacific, tropical depression formation might be more consistent and less affected by extreme ENSO phases.\n",
    "**La Niña Influence**: During La Niña years, the frequency is slightly lower at 24.65 TDs per year. La Niña years tend to slightly reduce the frequency of tropical depressions compared to Neutral years but are still more active than El Niño years.\n",
    "**El Niño Influence**: The lowest frequency is observed during El Niño years, with 23.84 TDs per year. The reduced frequency during El Niño years aligns with the general understanding that El Niño conditions can shift tropical cyclone activity eastward, reducing activity in the NW Pacific.\n",

    "**El Niño Influence**: The lowest frequency is again observed during El Niño years (14.16 TDs per year).

    "**Neutral Years**: The NW Pacific has the highest mean wind speed during Neutral years (117.14 knots), while the NE and Central Pacific also show strong storms but with a slightly lower mean (115.00 knots). This suggests that during Neutral years, both regions experience relatively high-intensity storms, with the NW Pacific showing slightly stronger storms on average.\n",
    "**La Niña Years**: The mean wind speed is higher in the NE and Central Pacific (117.41 knots) compared to the NW Pacific (108.82 knots). This suggests that La Niña conditions might be associated with stronger storms in the NE and Central Pacific than in the NW Pacific.\n",
    "**El Niño Years**: The mean wind speed is slightly higher in the NW Pacific (113.13 knots) compared to the NE and Central Pacific (114.80 knots), but the difference is minimal. This indicates that El Niño influences storm intensities similarly across both regions.\n",

The standard deviation is highest during El Niño years (28.59 knots) and lowest during La Niña years (22.25 knots). This suggests that while the mean wind speeds are similar, the NE and Central Pacific region experiences a wider range of storm intensities.\n",

    "3. *Range of Wind Speeds (Min and Max)*:\n",
    "**NE and Central Pacific**: The range of wind speeds is much broader, particularly during El Niño years, where the maximum wind speed reaches 185.0 knots. This suggests the presence of exceptionally strong storms during El Niño years in the NE and Central Pacific.\n",
    "**NW Pacific**: The wind speed range is narrower, with a maximum of 140.0 knots during Neutral years. This indicates that the NW Pacific experiences strong storms, but not as extreme as those in the NE and Central Pacific during the same period.\n",

    "*Observation:* The density difference plot shows higher density of tropical depressions (TDs) to the east and west of the Philippines during El Niño compared to La Niña.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Interpretation:* This suggests that during El Niño years, tropical depressions tend to remain more concentrated in the western Pacific, particularly around the Philippines, rather than quickly turning northeast and transitioning into extratropical systems. The tendency for TDs to linger in this region could indicate that the steering flow patterns during El Niño are less conducive to an early northeastward turn, potentially leading to prolonged impacts in the western Pacific, including increased storm activity and potential landfall in the Philippines and nearby regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**La Niña Period:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Observation:* The density difference plot indicates a higher concentration of TDs near Japan during La Niña compared to El Niño.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Interpretation:* This pattern suggests that during La Niña years, tropical depressions are more likely to take a northeasterly track, moving towards Japan and becoming extratropical systems. The shift in TD concentration toward Japan implies that the atmospheric conditions during La Niña favor an earlier and more consistent northeastward movement of storms, increasing the likelihood of storm impacts in Japan and surrounding areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neutral Phase:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Observation:* The main difference in TD concentration during the Neutral phase is observed around the Marshall Islands.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Interpretation:* This indicates that during Neutral years, the spatial distribution of TDs shifts somewhat, with a notable increase in activity around the Marshall Islands. This could reflect a more balanced atmospheric circulation pattern during Neutral phases, where the conditions neither strongly favor the patterns observed during El Niño nor La Niña. The increased activity around the Marshall Islands might suggest a broader range of storm tracks, with some TDs originating or intensifying in this region before potentially moving towards either the western Pacific or northeastward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation for the Central and NE Pacific:\n",
    "\n",
    "**El Niño Period:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Observation:* The density difference plot shows a higher density of tropical depressions (TDs) in the region around 130°W, extending westward toward Hawaii.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Interpretation:* This suggests that during El Niño years, tropical depressions are more likely to follow a westward track, increasing the likelihood of impacting the Hawaiian Islands compared to La Niña years. The altered atmospheric and oceanic conditions during El Niño may lead to a more westward steering flow, which pushes TDs towards the central Pacific, making landfall on Hawaii more probable.\n",

    "*Observation:* The density difference plot indicates a higher concentration of TDs near the coast of Mexico.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Interpretation:* This pattern suggests that during La Niña years, tropical depressions are more likely to develop and intensify near Mexico, with a greater chance of making landfall there compared to El Niño years. La Niña conditions typically favor stronger easterly trade winds and a more conducive environment for tropical cyclone formation near the eastern Pacific, leading to more frequent landfalls in Mexico.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neutral Phase:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Observation:* The Neutral phase, when compared to both El Niño and La Niña, shows that tropical depression activity tends to be more evenly distributed across the Pacific, rather than being concentrated in specific regions. However, there are still distinct areas where El Niño and La Niña exert stronger influences.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Interpretation compared to El Niño:* This suggests that during Neutral years, there is a higher density of tropical depressions (TDs) in the broader Pacific region compared to El Niño years. However, during El Niño, the density of TDs is particularly concentrated southeast of California and around Hawaii. The strong blue southeast of California indicates that during El Niño, more tropical depressions tend to form or pass through this area, while the light blue around Hawaii suggests a similar, but less pronounced, tendency for TDs to impact the region during El Niño. In contrast, during Neutral years, the overall activity is more spread out across the Pacific, but with less concentration in these specific regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Interpretation  compared to La Niña:* Neutral years again show more evenly spread activity, while La Niña creates a strong concentration of TDs off the coast of Mexico, indicating a marked difference in behavior between these phases."

    "The El Niño phase has the highest number of clusters (36), indicating a more fragmented distribution of tropical depressions (TDs) across the NW Pacific during El Niño years. This fragmentation suggests that TDs are spread over a wider area, forming more distinct clusters.\n",
    "The La Niña phase has the fewest clusters (18), suggesting that TDs tend to be more concentrated in fewer areas, likely due to stronger and more consistent steering currents or favorable conditions in specific regions.\n",

    "The La Niña phase has the largest average cluster size (1299.33), suggesting that when clusters do form during La Niña, they tend to be larger and possibly more intense. This could be due to more favorable and concentrated conditions for TD development in certain regions.\n",
    "The El Niño phase has the smallest average cluster size (589.81), which aligns with the higher number of clusters. This suggests that while there are more clusters, they are generally smaller and less concentrated, possibly due to more variable conditions across the region.\n",
